<!-- # About the project -->

<p align="justify"> The Persian Constructicon is still in its early stages of development. At present, it includes over 70 constructions, which are not yet fully annotated or thoroughly described. However, ongoing work is being carried out, and these constructions will be fully detailed and refined in the near future. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and well-documented resource for researchers and linguists interested in Persian constructions. </p>
